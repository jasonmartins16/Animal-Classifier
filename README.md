*index.html:
->contains the frontend ui including from html, css to javascript

*main.py
->is the flask api which connect the model to the frontend

*model/classify.py
->is the model which has been trained on roughly 400 images of 15 different animal class combined

->You can gather custom dataset according to the class labels and also train this model accordingly on more animal names, you just need to change the path of the directory/folder where you have stored the images, you can also fine tune this model to enhace the performance
